        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/My_Chemical_Romance"> My Chemical Romance (commonly acronymized to MCR or abbreviated to My Chem)</a> is an American rock band from Newark, New Jersey. The band's current lineup consists of lead vocalist Gerard Way, guitarists Ray Toro and Frank Iero, and bassist Mikey Way. Founded by Gerard, Mikey, Toro, and Matt Pelissier (and later joined by Iero), the band signed to Eyeball Records and released their debut album, I Brought You My Bullets, You Brought Me Your Love, in 2002. They signed with Reprise Records the next year and released their major-label debut, Three Cheers for Sweet Revenge, in 2004. Shortly after the album's release, Pelissier was replaced by Bob Bryar. A commercial success, the album was awarded platinum status over a year later.

        The band eclipsed the success of their previous albums with their 2006 concept album, The Black Parade, which gained generally favorable reviews among music critics and was certified double platinum in the United States and the United Kingdom, the band's only double platinum. After the departure of long-time drummer Bob Bryar in March 2010, the band released their fourth studio album, Danger Days: The True Lives of the Fabulous Killjoys, in November that same year, to positive reviews. The band replaced Bryar on tour with drummers including Michael Pedicone and Jarrod Alexander. After the addition of touring keyboardist James Dewees in 2012 and the release of Conventional Weapons, a series of singles recorded in 2009, released over the course of five months, the band announced its breakup on March 22, 2013, one month after the final release in the Conventional Weapons series. After the band's split, a greatest hits album titled May Death Never Stop You was released in March 2014. A tenth-anniversary reissue of The Black Parade, including demos and live versions of the B-sides from the album and an early version of "Welcome to the Black Parade", titled "The Five of Us Are Dying", was released on September 23, 2016, titled The Black Parade/Living with Ghosts.
        
        The band reunited out of the public eye in 2017 and announced a reunion show on October 31, 2019, which took place in Los Angeles on December 20, 2019, extending this to a small tour consisting of dates in Australia, New Zealand and Japan a week later.
